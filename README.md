# swift-ui-plus-combine-clean-architecture

This project is created under iOS 15.2 and Swift 5 using the following features:

* SwiftUI
* Combine
* Clean architecture
* MVVM
* Dependency Injection

The challenge is proof my gained skills from I developed first approach up to now.

You can see first iteration where I did not use any of the mentioned features due to lack of knowledge.
